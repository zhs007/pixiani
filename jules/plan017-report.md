# Task 11: Fix Race Condition in Animation Loading - Report

This report details the diagnosis and resolution of a race condition that prevented newly created animations from appearing in the UI immediately after the agent's workflow completed.

## 1. Task Summary

After the agent's TDD workflow was made fully functional, a new bug emerged. The agent would report the successful creation of a new animation, but the animation would not appear in the preview panel's dropdown list, requiring a manual page refresh to show up. This pointed to a synchronization issue between the backend file creation and the frontend data fetching.

The goal of this task was to eliminate this bug and ensure that new animations are loaded into the UI reliably and instantly upon creation.

## 2. Implementation Details

The root cause was identified as a classic race condition. The frontend was attempting to re-fetch the list of all animations milliseconds after being notified of the workflow's completion. This request would often arrive before the server's filesystem had fully updated, leading to an incomplete list being sent back.

The solution was to refactor the process to be more explicit and eliminate the need for the frontend to re-discover the new file.

### 2.1. Backend Enhancement (`editor/server.ts`)

The backend was enhanced to provide more information to the client upon task completion.

- **Capture File Path:** In the `/api/chat` endpoint, the logic for the `create_animation_file` tool call was updated. In addition to capturing the new animation's `className`, it now also captures the full `filePath` of the `.ts` file that was just written to the disk.
- **Enrich Completion Event:** The `workflow_complete` Server-Sent Event (SSE) was enriched. It now sends a payload containing both the `className` and the exact `filePath` of the new animation.
  ```json
  {
    "type": "workflow_complete",
    "className": "MyNewAnimation",
    "filePath": "/path/to/.sessions/session-id/src/animations/MyNewAnimation.ts"
  }
  ```

### 2.2. Frontend Refactoring (`editor/web/components/App.tsx`)

The frontend was refactored to use this new, more direct information, making the loading process more robust.

- **Direct Import Logic:** The `workflow_complete` event handler was completely rewritten.
- It no longer calls `loadCustomAnimations()` (which re-fetched the entire list).
- Instead, it now uses the `filePath` directly from the event payload to dynamically import the single new animation module using Vite's special `/@fs/` path: `import(/* @vite-ignore */ \`/@fs/${filePath}\`)`.
- Upon a successful import, the new animation class is registered with the `AnimationManager`, added to the existing `availableAnimations` state, and immediately set as the selected animation in the UI.

## 3. Final Outcome

This change completely resolves the race condition. The UI update is no longer dependent on a separate, time-sensitive API call. Instead, the frontend is explicitly told where to find the new animation, guaranteeing that it can be loaded and displayed the moment the agent's work is finished. This makes the editor's workflow more reliable and provides the seamless user experience that was originally intended.
