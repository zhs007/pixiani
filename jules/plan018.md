1.  **Create Plan and Report Files.**
    *   I will create `jules/plan018.md` to document this plan.
    *   At the end of the task, I will create `jules/plan018-report.md`.

2.  **Diagnose `BaseAnimate` State Bug.**
    *   I will read `src/core/BaseAnimate.ts` to investigate the implementation of the `state` property and the `setState` method to identify the source of the bug.

3.  **Fix `BaseAnimate` State Bug.**
    *   Based on my diagnosis, I will modify `src/core/BaseAnimate.ts` to ensure that calling `setState` correctly and immediately updates the animation's `state` property.

4.  **Validate the Fix using Agent's Code.**
    *   I will create the `ComplexRotationAnimation.ts` and `ComplexRotationAnimation.test.ts` files, using the exact code provided by the agent in the user's prompt.
    *   I will place these files in the appropriate `src/animations/` and `tests/animations/` directories.
    *   I will then run the entire test suite with `npm run test`.
    *   I will verify that the test suite passes, paying close attention to the output for `ComplexRotationAnimation.test.ts` to confirm the specific state assertion error is resolved.
    *   After successful validation, I will remove the temporary animation and test files.

5.  **Update Project Documentation.**
    *   If the fix to the core `BaseAnimate` class is significant, I will update `jules.md` to reflect the change.
