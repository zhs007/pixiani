# Task 9: Fix Sandboxed Test Execution - Report

This report details the diagnosis and resolution of a critical issue preventing the agent from running tests in its sandboxed environment, and the implementation of more robust error handling.

## 1. Task Summary

The previous agent workflow had two significant flaws identified by the user:

1.  **Test Environment Failure:** The agent would correctly create animation and test files in a sandboxed `.sessions/<session-id>` directory, but the `vitest` test runner would fail to find and execute them, reporting a "No test files found" error.
2.  **Poor Agent Termination:** When faced with this unrecoverable environment error, the agent would simply give up without providing a clear reason to the user.

The goal of this task was to fix the test environment so that sandboxed tests run correctly, and to make the agent intelligent enough to recognize and properly report unrecoverable environment errors.

## 2. Implementation Details

The solution involved changes to the project's test configuration and the agent's core logic in `editor/server.ts`.

### 2.1. Fixing the Test Environment

*   **Diagnosis:** I began by inspecting the project's `vitest.config.ts` file. The root cause was not an `exclude` rule as initially suspected, but a restrictive `include` rule: `include: ['tests/**/*.test.ts']`. This configuration explicitly told `vitest` to *only* look for tests in the root `tests/` directory, thereby ignoring any tests in other locations, including the sandboxed `.sessions/` directories.
*   **Solution:** I updated the `include` array in `vitest.config.ts` to also look for tests inside the session directories:
    ```typescript
    include: ['tests/**/*.test.ts', '.sessions/**/tests/**/*.test.ts'],
    ```
    This is a simple and robust fix that allows the test runner to discover and execute tests generated by the agent during its workflow.
*   **Verification:** I verified this fix by creating a dummy session directory and test file and successfully running `vitest` against it using the same command as the agent's `run_tests` tool.

### 2.2. Improving Agent Error Handling

To make the agent more resilient, I improved its ability to distinguish between its own code errors (which it should try to fix) and underlying system issues (which it cannot fix).

*   **Error Detection in `run_tests`:** I modified the `run_tests` function in `editor/server.ts`. It now inspects the output of the `vitest` command. If it detects the specific string "No test files found", it no longer returns the raw output. Instead, it returns a special, structured error message:
    ```
    SYSTEM_ERROR: Test runner could not find the test file. This is an environment issue...
    ```
*   **Updating Agent Instructions:** I updated the agent's main system prompt. A new section on "Error Handling" was added, which explicitly instructs the agent on how to behave:
    *   If a normal test failure occurs, it should proceed with its debugging loop as before.
    *   If it receives a message starting with `SYSTEM_ERROR:`, it must immediately terminate its workflow and report the system error to the user as its final answer.

## 3. Final Outcome

With these changes, the system is now significantly more robust:

1.  The agent's test-driven development loop is now fully functional, as tests generated in the sandboxed environment can be correctly executed.
2.  The agent is now "smarter" and will not get stuck attempting to fix unrecoverable environment problems. It will instead fail gracefully and provide a clear explanation to the user.

This completes the work on fixing the agent's core workflow and reliability.
