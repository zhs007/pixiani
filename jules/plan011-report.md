# Task Report: Plan 011

## Task Summary

The user requested a "black hole" animation where a sprite appears to be rotated and pulled into its center over a 3-second duration.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Animation: `VortexAnimation`

-   I created the `VortexAnimation` class in `src/animations/VortexAnimation.ts`.
-   Following the successful pattern from the `FlagWaveAnimation`, this animation uses a `PIXI.MeshPlane` to deform the sprite's texture. A 20x20 grid was used to ensure a smooth visual effect.
-   The core of the animation is in the `update` method, which uses polar coordinates to achieve the vortex effect. For each vertex in the mesh, its position is converted to an angle and radius from the center. These values are then animated over time: the angle is increased to create a spiral, and the radius is decreased to pull the image into the center.
-   The number of spirals is a configurable parameter within the class, making the effect easy to adjust.

### 2. Integration & Testing

-   The new animation was exported from `src/index.ts` and registered in the `demo/main.ts` file, making it immediately available in the demo application.
-   A new test suite was created in `tests/animations/VortexAnimation.test.ts`.
-   The tests verify the core mechanics: that the mesh is created and destroyed correctly, and that the vertex data is modified by the `update` method.
-   A specific test was added to verify that at the end of the 3-second animation, all vertices have been successfully pulled to the center of the mesh, confirming the animation's end state.

### 4. Verification

-   All programmatic checks specified in `AGENTS.md` passed without issue:
    -   `npm run test`: All 57 tests passed.
    -   `npm run build`: The library and demo both built successfully.

## Conclusion

The task is complete. The `VortexAnimation` provides a powerful and visually complex effect, demonstrating the flexibility of using meshes for advanced animations. The implementation is robust, tested, and fully integrated into the library.
