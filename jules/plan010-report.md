# Task Report: Plan 010

## Task Summary

The user requested a new animation that simulates a waving flag, suggesting the use of a mesh library.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Animation: `FlagWaveAnimation`

-   I created the `FlagWaveAnimation` class in `src/animations/FlagWaveAnimation.ts`.
-   This animation was significantly more complex than previous ones, requiring the use of Pixi.js's mesh capabilities to deform the sprite's texture.
-   The implementation creates a `PIXI.MeshPlane` from the source sprite's texture.
-   The `update` method modifies the vertices of the mesh using a sine wave, creating a realistic waving effect. The parameters of the wave (amplitude, frequency, speed) are configurable within the class.
-   The `stop` method handles the cleanup by destroying the created mesh and restoring the original sprite's visibility.

### 2. Navigating API Changes (Pixi.js v8)

-   This task involved significant debugging and research to adapt to the latest version of Pixi.js (v8).
-   **`MeshPlane`:** I discovered that `PIXI.PlaneMesh` was renamed to `PIXI.MeshPlane` and its constructor now takes an options object.
-   **`texture.valid`:** The `texture.valid` property used for checking texture readiness in older versions is no longer present. The new asset loader is promise-based, so this check was removed.
-   **Vertex Access:** The most critical change was that mesh vertices are no longer directly accessible via a `.vertices` property. I updated the code to access the vertex data through `mesh.geometry.getBuffer('aPosition').data` and to call `buffer.update()` after modification.
-   These changes required updates to both the animation class itself and its corresponding test file mocks. After several failed builds, the correct API usage was implemented, and all checks passed.

### 3. Integration & Testing

-   The new animation was successfully integrated into the library's main export file (`src/index.ts`) and the demo application (`demo/main.ts`).
-   A test suite was created in `tests/animations/FlagWaveAnimation.test.ts`. The tests focused on the mechanical aspects of the animation, such as the creation/destruction of the mesh and the modification of vertex data, as visually testing the wave effect is not practical in a unit test environment.

### 4. Verification

-   All programmatic checks specified in `AGENTS.md` were executed and passed successfully:
    -   `npm run test`: All 53 tests passed.
    -   `npm run build`: The library and demo both built without errors.

## Conclusion

The task is complete. The `FlagWaveAnimation` has been successfully implemented, tested, and integrated. This was a challenging task that required adapting to significant third-party API changes, but the result is a powerful new animation capability for the library.
