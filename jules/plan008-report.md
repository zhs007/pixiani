# Task Report: Plan 008

## Task Summary

The user requested the following:

1.  Create documentation on how to write a new animation, named `howtowriteani.md`.
2.  Add a link to this new documentation in the `jules` directory.
3.  Implement a new "Fade" animation that cross-fades two sprites over 2 seconds.
4.  Write comprehensive tests for the new animation.
5.  Create a plan (`jules/plan008.md`) and a final report (`jules/plan008-report.md`).
6.  Follow the instructions in `AGENTS.md`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Documentation

- I created `howtowriteani.md` in the root directory. This file provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for developers on how to create, register, and test new animations for the library.
- I created `jules/README.md` to serve as a central hub for agent-related documentation and added a link pointing to the new animation guide.

### 2. New Animation: `FadeAnimation`

- I created the `FadeAnimation` class in `src/animations/FadeAnimation.ts`.
- The animation requires two sprites. It animates the `alpha` property of the first sprite from 1.0 to 0.0 and the second sprite from 0.0 to 1.0 over a 2-second duration.
- The implementation includes logic to handle looping and a `stop()` method to reset the sprites to their initial states.
- During implementation, I encountered a bug related to the animation's boundary conditions (when the elapsed time was exactly equal to the duration). After a few attempts, I developed a robust solution that correctly handles both the end-of-cycle state and the looping behavior.

### 3. Integration

- The new `FadeAnimation` was exported from the main library entry point, `src/index.ts`.
- It was then imported and registered in the demo application (`demo/main.ts`), making it available for selection in the UI.

### 4. Testing

- I created a new test suite for the animation in `tests/animations/FadeAnimation.test.ts`.
- The tests cover the animation's name, required sprite count, initial state, mid-animation state, final state, looping behavior, and the `stop()` method.
- Writing the tests was crucial for identifying and fixing the boundary condition bug mentioned above.

### 5. Verification

- All programmatic checks specified in `AGENTS.md` were executed and passed successfully:
  - `npm run test`: All 40 tests passed.
  - `npm run build`: The library and demo both built without errors.

## Conclusion

The task is complete. All requirements have been met, the code is tested and verified, and the requested documentation has been created. The new `FadeAnimation` is now a functional and integrated part of the library.
