# Task 13: Implement Staging Area for Agent Workflow - Report

This report details the implementation of a "staging and publish" architecture to prevent the Vite development server from crashing due to syntax errors in agent-generated code.

## 1. Task Summary

A critical flaw was discovered in the agent's workflow: if the agent generated a file with a syntax error, the Vite development server would immediately try to compile it, causing the entire server process to crash. This happened because the agent was writing its "work-in-progress" files directly to a directory that was being watched by Vite.

The goal of this task was to re-architect the agent's file management system to create a "staging area," ensuring that only code that has successfully passed all tests is "published" and made visible to the Vite server.

## 2. Implementation Details

The solution involved a significant refactoring of the file and workflow management logic in `editor/server.ts`.

### 2.1. Introduction of the Staging Area

*   **`write_file` Modification:** The core `write_file` function was modified. It no longer writes to the final session directory (e.g., `.sessions/<id>/src/`). Instead, all files are now written to a dedicated `staging` subdirectory (e.g., `.sessions/<id>/staging/src/`). This applies to all file creation and update tools used by the agent.
*   **`run_tests` Update:** The `run_tests` tool was updated to look for test files within this new `staging` directory, ensuring that the tests are run against the work-in-progress code.

### 2.2. The "Publish on Success" Workflow

The most critical change was the introduction of an explicit "publish" step in the agent's workflow.

*   **New `publish_files` Function:** A new helper function, `publish_files`, was created. This function is responsible for moving files from the `staging` directory to their final "published" location (the parent session directory). It uses `fs.rename` for an efficient move operation.
*   **Workflow Integration:** The main agent loop in the `/api/chat` endpoint was modified. Now, immediately after the `run_tests` tool returns a success message, the loop calls `publish_files`.
*   **Event Trigger:** The `workflow_complete` event, which signals the frontend to load the new animation, is now sent only *after* the `publish_files` function completes successfully. The file path included in this event is the final, published path.

## 3. Final Outcome

This new **"Stage -> Test -> Publish"** architecture completely solves the server crashing issue.

*   **Stability:** The Vite development server is now protected from syntax errors or other issues in code that has not yet been validated, as it never sees the files in the `staging` area.
*   **Reliability:** The agent's workflow is more robust. A file is only made available to the rest of the application after it has been proven to be syntactically correct and has passed its own test suite.
*   **Clarity:** The separation between "work-in-progress" and "published" code makes the entire process clearer and more aligned with standard software development CI/CD practices.

This architectural improvement provides a stable foundation for further development of the agent's capabilities.
