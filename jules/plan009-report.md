# Task Report: Plan 009

## Task Summary

The user requested a new, complex animation with multiple distinct phases of scaling, rotation, and fading.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Animation: `ComplexPopAnimation`

-   I created the `ComplexPopAnimation` class in `src/animations/ComplexPopAnimation.ts`.
-   The animation uses a single sprite and has a total duration of 1.5 seconds.
-   The `update` method was implemented as a state machine, with `if/else if` blocks corresponding to each of the 6 phases of the animation timeline.
-   A simulated Y-axis rotation was implemented by manipulating the sprite's `scale.x` property using a cosine wave, which provides a smooth spinning effect.
-   During testing, I discovered a bug related to the animation's end boundary condition, which was identical to a bug from a previous task. I applied the same fix: ensuring that when the `elapsedTime` exactly matches the `DURATION`, the animation state for the final frame is correctly rendered before the time loops for the next cycle.

### 2. Integration

-   The new `ComplexPopAnimation` was exported from `src/index.ts`.
-   It was then imported and registered in the `demo/main.ts` file, making it available for selection in the demo application's UI.

### 3. Testing

-   I created a new test suite for the animation in `tests/animations/ComplexPopAnimation.test.ts`.
-   The tests verify the state of the sprite's `scale` and `alpha` at the boundary of each of the animation's phases.
-   The tests were essential for catching the boundary condition bug and verifying the fix.

### 4. Verification

-   All programmatic checks specified in `AGENTS.md` were executed and passed successfully:
    -   `npm run test`: All 49 tests passed.
    -   `npm run build`: The library and demo both built without errors.

## Conclusion

The task is complete. The new `ComplexPopAnimation` has been implemented as requested, with robust logic to handle its complex timeline and boundary conditions. It is fully tested and integrated into the library and demo application.
