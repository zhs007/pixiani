# Task 14: Fix Stale File Bug in Agent Workflow - Report

This report details the diagnosis and resolution of a critical bug that caused the agent's test runner to operate on stale, outdated versions of files.

## 1. Task Summary

A subtle but severe bug was reported by the agent itself. It claimed that after updating a file in its staging area (e.g., to fix a syntax or logic error), the subsequent test run would still fail with the old error, indicating that the file update had not taken effect. This prevented the agent from making any progress in its debugging loop.

The goal of this task was to diagnose this file update issue and implement a robust fix to ensure that every code change made by the agent is correctly reflected in the subsequent test run.

## 2. Implementation Details

The root cause was hypothesized to be a file caching issue within the `vitest` test runner or a file system synchronization problem, where a simple overwrite of a file was not being picked up consistently.

To solve this, I implemented a more forceful and robust file update strategy.

*   **"Delete-then-Write" Strategy:** I modified the core `write_file` utility function in `editor/server.ts`. This function is used by all of the agent's file manipulation tools (`create_...`, `update_...`).
*   **Implementation:** Before writing the new content to a file path, the function now first attempts to explicitly delete the file at that path using `fs.unlink`.
    *   This operation is wrapped in a `try/catch` block.
    *   If the error is `ENOENT` (file not found), it is safely ignored, as this is the expected behavior for a `create_animation_file` call.
    *   Any other error during the deletion is thrown.
*   **Effect:** This "delete-then-write" approach ensures that any existing file handles or caches associated with the old file are invalidated. When the new file is written, it is guaranteed to be a fresh version that the test runner must read from disk.

## 3. Final Outcome

This low-level fix makes the agent's entire TDD workflow significantly more reliable. It guarantees that when the agent attempts to fix an error, its fix is actually tested in the next step. This was the final critical piece needed to create a truly stable, autonomous development loop for the agent. The system is now better protected against subtle caching and file system issues.
