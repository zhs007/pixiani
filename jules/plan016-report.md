# Task 10: Fix Module Alias Resolution for Sandboxed Tests - Report

This report details the diagnosis and resolution of a critical module alias resolution issue that prevented the agent's sandboxed tests from running.

## 1. Task Summary

Following the previous fix to the test runner's file discovery, a deeper issue was uncovered. The agent's generated tests were failing with the error: `Failed to resolve import "pixi-animation-library"`. This indicated that while the test _file_ was being found, the test _runner_ could not resolve the project's internal library alias when executing code within the sandboxed `.sessions` directory.

The goal of this task was to diagnose the root cause of this module resolution failure and implement a permanent fix to ensure the agent's TDD workflow is fully functional.

## 2. Implementation Details

The solution required a deep dive into the project's Vite and Vitest configuration.

### 2.1. Diagnosis

The investigation proceeded as follows:

1.  I first checked `vitest.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` for an alias definition, but none was found.
2.  I then inspected `package.json` and found that the project's `name` is `pixi-animation-library`. This allows for internal imports via an `npm`-managed symlink in `node_modules`, but this was not being picked up by the test runner in the sandboxed context.
3.  The breakthrough came from inspecting `demo/vite.config.ts`. This file, used for the project's demonstration page, contained the explicit alias definition:
    ```typescript
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        'pixi-animation-library': resolve(__dirname, '../src/index.ts'),
      },
    },
    ```
4.  This confirmed the diagnosis: The `vitest` command, as executed by the `run_tests` tool in `editor/server.ts`, was not loading this specific Vite configuration file and was therefore unaware of the necessary alias.

### 2.2. Solution

With a clear diagnosis, the fix was targeted and simple.

- I modified the `run_tests` function in `editor/server.ts`.
- I updated the `vitest` command to include the `--config` flag, explicitly telling it to use the configuration file from the `demo` directory.
- **Old command:** `npx vitest run "${testFilePath}" --root "${ROOT_DIR}"`
- **New command:** `npx vitest run "${testFilePath}" --root "${ROOT_DIR}" --config demo/vite.config.ts`

This change ensures that `vitest` always loads the correct configuration, inherits the crucial `resolve.alias` setting, and can successfully run tests from any location, including the agent's sandboxed session directories.

### 2.3. Verification

I validated the fix by creating a temporary test file in a `.sessions` directory that imported a module using the `pixi-animation-library` alias. I then executed the new command, and the test ran successfully, confirming the fix.

## 3. Final Outcome

The agent's test-driven development workflow is now, finally, fully operational. The test runner can discover test files in the sandbox, and it can correctly resolve internal module aliases, allowing the tests to run as intended. This removes a major blocker and significantly increases the reliability of the agent's code generation process.
