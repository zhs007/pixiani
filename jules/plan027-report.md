# Report for Multi-line Chat Input Task

## Task Summary

The goal of this task was to modify the chat input in the editor application to support multi-line input. This involved several changes to the `ChatPanel.tsx` component.

## Implementation Details

1.  **Removed Enter Key Submission:** The `onKeyDown` event handler was removed from the `<textarea>` element to prevent the Enter key from submitting the form. Messages can now only be sent by clicking the "Send" button.

2.  **Dynamic Textarea Height:**
    - The `<textarea>` was converted to a controlled component with its height managed by React state.
    - An `useEffect` hook was added to automatically adjust the height of the textarea based on its `scrollHeight` as the user types.
    - The textarea now starts with a height of a single line and can grow up to a maximum height of 200px.
    - The `resize` style was set to `none` to disable manual resizing.

3.  **Height Reset on Send:** The height of the textarea automatically resets to its initial single-line height when a message is sent. This is achieved because the `inputText` is cleared, which triggers the `useEffect` to recalculate the height.

## Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was a build failure caused by a syntax error. When converting the `ChatPanel` component from a concise return to a block body to accommodate the new hooks, I forgot to wrap the JSX in parentheses in the return statement. This was quickly identified from the build error message ("Unexpected end of file") and fixed.

## Verification

All verification steps were completed successfully:

- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm test`
- The development server was started with `pnpm dev:editor`.

The application is confirmed to be in a working state.
