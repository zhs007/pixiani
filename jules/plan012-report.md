# Plan 012 Completion Report: Editor Feature Enhancement

## Task Summary
This plan involved a major overhaul of the animation editor's user interface and core animation logic. All requested features were implemented successfully.

## 1. Feature Implementation
- **Animation Controls:** Added a "Loop" checkbox and a "Speed" input field to the preview panel, allowing users to control animation playback.
- **Asset Selection:** Implemented a comprehensive asset selection modal. Users can now choose from existing sprites or upload new ones directly within the editor. This involved both frontend UI work and new backend API endpoints for listing and uploading assets.
- **Pixi.js Rendering:** Adjusted the Pixi.js canvas to have its origin at the center, and all animations now default to this centered position for a more intuitive layout.
- **Chat UI Enhancements:** The chat input area was doubled in height for easier multi-line input, and message rendering now supports GitHub Flavored Markdown, allowing for richer text formatting in the chat history.

## 2. Core Library Refactoring
A significant portion of the work involved a robust refactoring of the core animation library to support the new features, specifically looping.
- **State Machine:** Implemented a formal state machine (`IDLE`, `PLAYING`, `PAUSED`, `ENDED`) within the `BaseAnimate` class. This makes the animation lifecycle explicit and easier to manage.
- **Looping Logic:** The `BaseAnimate` class now contains the logic to automatically handle looping. When a finite animation reaches its `ENDED` state, the base class checks the `loop` property and restarts the animation if true.
- **Speed Control:** The `AnimationManager` was updated to respect both global and per-animation speed modifiers.
- **Test Suite Overhaul:** A major effort was undertaken to fix and update the entire test suite to reflect the new state machine architecture, ensuring all changes are covered by tests.

## 3. Verification
- **Unit Tests:** All 55 unit tests in the suite now pass, confirming the correctness of the refactored animation logic and new features.
- **Build:** The project (both the library and the demo applications) builds successfully without errors.

## Final Outcome
The editor is now significantly more powerful and user-friendly. The core animation library is more robust, scalable, and maintainable due to the new state machine architecture. All user requirements from the initial request have been met and verified.
