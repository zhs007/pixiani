# Report for Project: Gemini Animation Editor

## Summary

This project involved creating a new web-based sub-project, the "Gemini Animation Editor". The editor allows users to generate, preview, and download custom Pixi.js animations by interacting with the Gemini AI model. The project was successfully completed, delivering a feature-rich tool integrated into the main project's structure.

## Process

The initial approach of creating a separate, independent Node.js project within the `editor` directory was blocked by persistent `npm` errors in the environment. After consulting the user, a more robust strategy was adopted:

1.  **Integration:** The `editor` was integrated as a non-independent part of the main project, with all dependencies managed in the root `package.json`.
2.  **Backend:** A Fastify server was built to handle API requests. It uses `@fastify/vite` to serve the frontend. The core logic involves taking user prompts, constructing a detailed system prompt for the Gemini API, and using Gemini's function calling feature to have the AI trigger the creation of new TypeScript animation files on the server's file system. Session management was implemented to keep user-generated content separate.
3.  **Frontend:** A React application was built to provide the user interface. It features a two-column layout for chat and previewing. The frontend handles communication with the backend, manages session state, and, most importantly, uses dynamic `import()` to load the newly generated animation modules at runtime. These modules are then registered with the existing `AnimationManager` and made available for playback in a Pixi.js canvas.

## Final Features

-   A fully functional chat interface for interacting with the AI.
-   Dynamic generation and loading of new animation code.
-   A preview panel with a dropdown for all available animations (standard and generated).
-   A "Play" button to render the selected animation.
-   A "New Task" button that clears the conversation context.
-   A "Download" button to save the generated `.ts` file.
-   Instructions in `jules.md` on how to run the new editor, including setting up the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in a `.env` file.

## Conclusion

Despite the initial environmental challenges, the project was completed successfully by adapting the strategy. The final result is a powerful and useful tool that meets all the user's requirements.
