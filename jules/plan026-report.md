# Task Report: Modify `get_allowed_files` Tool

## 1. Task Execution Flow

1.  **Understood the Goal:** The initial request was to modify the `get_allowed_files` tool to return a JSON object with file descriptions, and to specify which files should be included.

2.  **Explored the Codebase:**
    - Read `jules.md` and `AGENTS.md` to understand the project context and conventions.
    - Located the `get_allowed_files` function in `apps/editor/server.ts`.
    - Listed the files in the specified directories (`packages/pixiani-engine/src`, `packages/pixiani-anis/src`, `packages/pixiani-anis/tests`) to gather the file paths.

3.  **Created `allowed_files.json`:**
    - Created a new file `apps/editor/allowed_files.json`.
    - Populated the file with the list of allowed files and their descriptions in the specified JSON format.

4.  **Modified `get_allowed_files`:**
    - Updated the function in `apps/editor/server.ts` to read `allowed_files.json`.
    - The function now returns the content of the JSON file directly.

5.  **Verified the Changes:**
    - Read both the new JSON file and the modified server file to ensure the changes were correct.

## 2. Problems Encountered and Solutions

- **Incorrect `ls` command:** I initially tried to use `ls -R` which is not a supported syntax for the `ls` tool. I corrected this by using `ls` on each directory individually.
- **Plan format:** My first attempt at creating a plan used an incorrect format. I corrected the format and resubmitted the plan.
- **Plan file already exists:** I tried to create a plan file that already existed. I resolved this by using a different name for the plan file.

## 3. Final Code State

The `get_allowed_files` tool now provides a much more informative output for the agent, which will help it make better decisions about which files to read. The code is cleaner and more maintainable, as the list of allowed files is now managed in a separate configuration file.
