# Task 8: Autonomous Agent Workflow - Report

This report details the implementation of an autonomous, streaming workflow for the Gemini agent in the animation editor, addressing feedback from the previous version.

## 1. Task Summary

The goal of this task was to resolve three key issues with the editor's agent:

1.  **Lack of Autonomy:** The agent paused after every tool call, requiring manual user intervention to proceed.
2.  **Poor User Feedback:** The user had no visibility into the agent's process, leading to long, uncertain waits.
3.  **Delayed Animation Preview:** Newly created animations were not immediately available for preview in the editor's interface.

To address these, the agent's workflow needed to be fully automated, provide real-time feedback, and seamlessly integrate new animations into the UI upon completion. A step limit was also introduced to prevent infinite loops.

## 2. Implementation Details

The solution required a significant refactoring of both the backend server and the frontend application.

### 2.1. Backend Refactoring (`editor/server.ts`)

The core of the backend changes was to move from a simple request-response model to a streaming model using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

*   **Endpoint Change:** The `/api/chat` endpoint was changed from a `POST` to a `GET` request. This was a strategic trade-off to simplify the frontend implementation by enabling the use of the native `EventSource` API, which does not support `POST`. The user's prompt is now sent as a URL query parameter.
*   **Agent Execution Loop:** A new execution loop was implemented within the `/api/chat` handler. This loop orchestrates the entire agent workflow autonomously.
    1.  It sends the initial user prompt to the Gemini model.
    2.  It enters a loop that continues as long as the model responds with a tool call.
    3.  A maximum step limit of **10** was implemented to prevent infinite execution.
    4.  The loop executes the requested tool and sends the result back to the model to get the next action.
*   **Real-time Streaming:** The endpoint now streams updates to the client. After each significant action (like a tool call), it sends a JSON-formatted event, allowing the frontend to display the agent's progress in real time.
*   **Completion Signal:** Once the agent's work is done (i.e., it responds with text instead of a tool call), the server sends a final `workflow_complete` event containing the class name of the newly created animation. It then closes the connection.

### 2.2. Frontend Refactoring (`editor/web/components/App.tsx`)

The frontend was updated to consume and react to the new data stream.

*   **`EventSource` Integration:** The `handleSendMessage` function was completely rewritten. It no longer uses `fetch()` to wait for a single response. Instead, it initializes an `EventSource` connection to the `/api/chat` endpoint.
*   **Real-time Feedback:** An `onmessage` event listener parses the incoming events from the server. Based on the event type (`tool_call`, `final_response`, etc.), it dynamically adds new messages to the chat panel, showing the user exactly what the agent is doing (e.g., "*Calling tool: `create_test_file`...*").
*   **Automatic Preview:** Upon receiving the `workflow_complete` event, the app automatically triggers two actions:
    1.  It calls `loadCustomAnimations()` to fetch the updated list of animations, including the new one.
    2.  It updates the `selectedAnimationName` state to the name of the new animation, which immediately selects it in the preview panel's dropdown menu.
*   **State Management:** The `onerror` event on the `EventSource` is used to detect when the server closes the stream. This is used to reliably set the `isThinking` state to `false`, re-enabling the UI for the user.

## 3. Challenges and Solutions

*   **Choosing a Streaming Technology:** The initial plan considered using `fetch` with `ReadableStream` to handle a `POST` request. However, this would have resulted in complex and verbose frontend code for parsing the stream.
    *   **Solution:** I made the decision to switch the backend to a `GET` request. This allowed the use of the much cleaner and simpler `EventSource` API on the frontend, leading to more maintainable code. This trade-off was deemed acceptable as the text prompts are unlikely to exceed URL length limits.
*   **State Management During Streaming:** It was challenging to manage the `isThinking` state and decide when to display the final response from the agent.
    *   **Solution:** I implemented a simple state machine within the `EventSource` handlers. Progress messages are added to the chat log as they arrive. The final text response from the agent is stored in a temporary variable and only added to the chat log in the `onerror` handler (which signifies the end of the stream). This ensures the final message always appears last. The `isThinking` state is also reliably toggled in the `onerror` handler.

## 4. Final Outcome

The editor now provides a much-improved user experience. The agent works autonomously from start to finish, the user can see its progress, and the result of its work is immediately available for use. The system is more robust, interactive, and aligned with the project's goals.
