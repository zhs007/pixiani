## PixiAni — Phase Report (plans 001–022)

Date: 2025-09-12

This document is a concise, developer-focused phase report summarizing the work described in `jules/plan001.md` through `jules/plan022.md` and their corresponding reports. It captures objectives, what was delivered, important implementation choices, outstanding issues (if any), and recommended next steps.

### Checklist (user request)
- [x] Read plans and reports up to `plan022` and identify missing files — Done (all available plan/report files read; `plan008.md` was not present, only `plan008-report.md` existed).
- [x] Produce a phase report and save it to `jules/phase-report.md` — Done (this file).

## Executive summary
- Scope: a TypeScript + Pixi.js animation library plus a Gemini-powered Animation Editor were designed and implemented across the repository.
- Outcome: Core animation framework (types, BaseObject, BaseAnimate, AnimationManager), several example animations, a demo page, an editor frontend and backend, an autonomous TDD workflow for the Gemini agent, test coverage, and build pipelines were completed and verified.
- Quality gates: Vitest unit tests, ESLint + Prettier, and build steps were integrated as part of the workflow; tests reported high coverage and repeatedly passed during the work described by the reports.

## Key milestones and delivered features

1. Project bootstrap and core library (plans 001–004)
  - Created project skeleton: `src/`, `tests/`, `demo/`, `assets/` and basic build/test scripts.
  - Implemented core modules in `src/core`: `types.ts`, `BaseObject.ts`, `BaseAnimate.ts`, `AnimationManager.ts`.
  - Added `ScaleAnimation` and related unit tests to validate core behavior.

2. Animations (plans 005–011)
  - Implemented multiple animations and tests:
    - `ScaleAnimation` (basic scale cycle)
    - `FadeAnimation` (cross-fade between two sprites)
    - `ComplexPopAnimation` (multi-phase pop effect)
    - `FlagWaveAnimation` (mesh-based waving using MeshPlane)
    - `VortexAnimation` (vortex/black-hole style mesh deformation)
  - Each animation includes tests focusing on mechanical behaviors (state, alpha/scale/vertex updates) and was integrated into the demo.

3. Editor and Gemini integration (plans 012–018)
  - Frontend: React app with ChatPanel, PreviewPanel, AssetSelectionModal; asset upload/listing and playback controls (loop, speed).
  - Backend: Fastify server with `@fastify/vite` used in dev. Added endpoints for assets, uploads, and a `/api/chat` workflow used by the Gemini model.
  - Implemented a TDD workflow for the Gemini agent: tools for listing/reading allowed files, creating/updating animation & test files, and running tests via `vitest` in sandboxed session directories.
  - Streaming improvements: switched `/api/chat` to SSE (GET + EventSource) to provide real-time progress and completed-work payloads to the frontend.

4. Reliability and safety improvements (plans 019–022)
  - Introduced a `staging` area (`.sessions/<id>/staging/`) for all agent-generated files. Tests run against staging; files are published only after tests pass.
  - Fixed vitest discovery and alias issues (added `.sessions/**/tests/**/*.test.ts` to include; forced vitest to use `demo/vite.config.ts` to pick up `resolve.alias` when running sandboxed tests).
  - Implemented robust file write strategy (delete-then-write) to avoid stale-file caching issues.
  - Standardized import strategy for agent-generated tests: relative import to the class-under-test inside session/staging, use `'pixi-animation-library'` alias for core exports.
  - Improved `run_tests` error reporting: `SYSTEM_ERROR:` messages now include full stdout/stderr so the agent and human can act on actionable logs.

## Notable implementation choices & rationale
- Single-root dependency model: Editor dependencies were moved into the root `package.json` rather than creating an independent editor package, to avoid environment install issues.
- ESM/flat ESLint config and Prettier were added to ensure consistent formatting and linting across `src`, `editor`, and `demo`.
- TDD loop for the agent: implementing sandboxed staging + run-tests + publish protects the dev server from syntax errors and enables automated verification before exposing generated code to the running app.
- Streaming (SSE) for backend→frontend: simple and reliable for progress events; chosen over fetch-stream for simplicity and native EventSource support in browsers.

## Issues encountered and how they were resolved (high-level)
- Dependency/peer-conflicts during ESLint/plugin install: resolved by choosing compatible plugin versions and consolidating to a single ESLint config file.
- Vitest test discovery in sessions: solved by updating `vitest.config.ts` include globs to match session paths.
- Module alias resolution for sandboxed tests: solved by passing `--config demo/vite.config.ts` to vitest so the `resolve.alias` was available.
- Race conditions when frontend re-fetched animations: solved by including `filePath` in the final event and using Vite's `/@fs/` import to load that single file directly.
- Stale-file / caching behavior: solved with delete-then-write to guarantee fresh files for the test runner.
- Core lifecycle bug discovered (`BaseAnimate.setState`): fixed to set `ENDED` state before checking loop and to only call `onComplete` when not looping.

## Current status (per repository artifacts and reports)
- All plans from 001 to 022 have corresponding report files. `plan008.md` itself was not present, but `plan008-report.md` documents the outcome for that task.
- Unit tests: test suites referenced in reports passed repeatedly (reports show progressive increases in tests, final counts in reports: 55+ tests passing depending on report snapshot).
- Editor workflows: streaming + TDD + staging + publish flow implemented and validated in reports.
- CI: project contains lint/format/typecheck/test/build steps (per prior automation work); reports indicate these checks were run during verification.

## Recommendations / next steps
1. Short-term (high priority)
  - Add a small `phase-report` section to the main `README.md` or `jules/README.md` linking to this file so reviewers can quickly spot the project maturity.
  - Add an automated daily (or pre-merge) smoke test that runs a minimal agent TDD cycle to catch environment regressions early (this can be a lightweight GH Action using a mock prompt and a very small animation generation + test).

2. Medium-term
  - Replace ad-hoc console logging with a small logging wrapper that honors levels and is easier to capture in server logs (useful for `editor/server.ts`).
  - Consider extracting the editor as a workspace package (pnpm/npm workspaces or similar) if you want independent versioning; keep the single-root approach if the team prefers simpler local dev.

3. Long-term
  - Harden security and sandboxing if the editor is exposed to multi-tenant or untrusted inputs. Right now the agent executes tests and writes files on disk; add stricter limits and resource caps when exposing to public users.
  - Add end-to-end tests that run the editor frontend (headless browser) and perform a real agent flow to detect integration regressions.

## Appendix: Quick mapping (high level)
- Core library: `src/core/*` — types, BaseObject, BaseAnimate, AnimationManager
- Animations: `src/animations/*` — multiple animations and unit tests in `tests/animations/*`
- Demo: `demo/` — demo page and `demo/main.ts`
- Editor backend: `editor/server.ts`
- Editor frontend: `editor/web/components/*` (App, ChatPanel, PreviewPanel, AssetSelectionModal)
- Agent workspace: `.sessions/<session-id>/staging/` (work-in-progress) and `.sessions/<session-id>/src` (published)

If you want, I can:
- Add a short entry to `jules/README.md` pointing to this phase report (I can create a small PR-like patch),
- Or generate a brief changelog-style summary for the repository root `README.md`.

End of report.
