# Jules' Project Log

## Project: Gemini Animation Editor

I have created a new sub-project called `editor`. This is a web-based tool that allows a user to generate new Pixi.js animations by describing them in plain text to a Gemini AI model.

### Features

- **AI-Powered Animation Generation**: Describe an animation, and the Gemini model will write the TypeScript code for it.
- **Live Preview**: Instantly load and play the generated animations in a Pixi.js canvas.
- **Session Management**: Each user has their own private session to create and view their animations.
- **Downloadable Code**: Download the generated `.ts` file for any animation you create.

### How to Run

1.  **Set up your environment**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
3.  Add your Gemini API key to the `.env` file:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
4.  Install dependencies (if you haven't already): `npm install`
5.  Run the editor's development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev:editor
    ```
6.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Next Steps

The project is now feature-complete as per the request. The next logical steps would be to add more robust error handling, write comprehensive tests for the new backend and frontend components, and potentially deploy it.
